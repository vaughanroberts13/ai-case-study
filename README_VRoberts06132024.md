# Enhanced Fraud Detection/Screening Capabilities in Commercial Banking
Prior to the near-term emergence of AI adoption by commercial business, specifically banking / financial services, fraud screening of transactions was limited to prescriptive based On-Prem software solutions.  The sheer volume of global transactions executed daily far exceeded the available resources; procedural, systematic and programmatically available to identify, halt and either clear or reject potential suspicious transactions leaving screening only of transaction subsets against established rulesets.
This imbalance has created an opportunity for many financial institutions to markedly improve various matrixes as false positives and increased sampling volume while maintaining quality control of the customer experience and transaction friction at an optimal threshold.

* When was the company incorporated?
1999
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Actimize began as a small company in 1999 in Israel’s Silicon Wadi, a 125-mile corridor across the coastal plain of Israel stretching from the most northern port to the southern desert. 
Founded by a group of former IDF (Israel Defense Forces) colleagues specializing in business intelligence and data warehousing, the company focused on anti-money laundering and fraud prevention software. Actimize was acquired by NICE Systems, a leading global provider of both cloud and on-premises enterprise software solutions, (NASDAQ: NICE) in July 2007 becoming one of the company’s three principle branches of activity.

## Results
The impact of leveraging cloud based, AI enriched transaction screening has been limited when viewing the full breadth of financial transaction screening on a global scale due to the financial investment required for implementation and integration with legacy data, model integration and support, the technological rate of change, the regulatory obligation ( domestic, international) and resources to support transition across multiple functions.

Based on the prevalence of being ring fenced behind exclusive partnerships and licensing agreements it’s becoming more apparent the providers leveraging LLM will have to hone their expertise in the build out of synthetic data and it’s effectiveness.
